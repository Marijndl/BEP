## Short description
Bachelor end project to conclude the bachelor Biomedical engineering at Technical university Eindhoven. 
In collaboration with UMCU ("universitair medisch centrum Utrecht"). Main goal: Development of a standardized procedure for the creation of calibrated MRI phantoms for MRI electrical properties mapping.\
Started 24-04-2023. 

## VNA results
The files necessary to reproduce the VNA results can be found in this main directory, see Round1_comparison for example.

## MRI results
The files necessary to reproduce the MRI results can be found in the folder MRI results. This also includes the different masks that were used to gather the voxels.

## Results figures
In the folder 'figures results', the figures can be seen that were used in the results section of the final report. These figures were mainly created in 'plot_excel_data.py'.

## Reproducibility
To get similar results to the work, a requirements.txt file has been included which describes all the versions of the packages that were used in this project. To use this file, execute the following command:
```python
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Furthermore, python version 3.9 was used to execute the scripts.
